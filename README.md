- 👋 Hi, I’m @pieterdepiet
- 💁‍♂️ Welcome, look around on my profile if you want
- 👀 I’m interested in challenging, new things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make a programming language in C ([repository](https://github.com/pieterdepiet/language))
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things I can learn from.
- 📫 How to reach me: Github messages is okay

## Experiences:
- Wrote my own SPA framework in Javascript
- Made an app with React and Firebase
- Made some nodejs servers
- Now working on C and making a programming language

## PS:
I would like to make a compiler, but there aren't many tutorials. Does anyone have a suggestion for a tuturial? Youtube video/book/website?
